### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on the payroll in a private project in the company I work, so, at the beginning I would like to collaborate on doing some simples examples about JAVA code, and after that, I will continue working on more complex projects.
I'm currently learning about some design patterns concepts, architectural styles, and architectural patterns.
I hope can learn as much as possible, and share those pieces of knowledge with the community
